# üëã Hi there

I'm a Senior Backend Developer with a decade of experience specializing in Python. My passion for Open Source projects ‚ù§Ô∏è stems from a belief that knowledge should be accessible to all who seek it.

My career has spanned diverse environments, from leading multi-million dollar projects for large corporations to nurturing smaller, innovative ventures. Regardless of scale, I approach each project with enthusiasm and dedication.

Originally from Venezuela üáªüá™ and currently based in Uruguay üá∫üáæ, I thrive in collaborative, dynamic settings. While I primarily use GitHub for work, my Git repositories are predominantly hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/rogs). 

Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!

# üöÄ Expertise
I'm a Python üêç expert with extensive experience in developing scalable applications and robust backend systems. I'm proficient in frameworks like Django üåê, Django REST Framework üöÄ, and FastAPI üöÖ, and have a deep understanding of database technologies including MySQL üê¨ and PostgreSQL üêò. 

My Python expertise extends to automation, web scraping, and data analysis, enabling me to solve complex problems efficiently. 

I'm also experienced in Docker üê≥ for containerization and have a strong background in Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI. I stay up-to-date with the latest Python advancements and best practices, ensuring that my code is always of the highest quality. 

Let's build something awesome together! üíªüöÄ"
